This is my portfolio built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has been deployed with the help of GitHub pages.

This portfolio is live due to the awesome [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkSvufmjEs) on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) by Kevin Powell.
